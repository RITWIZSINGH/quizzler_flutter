# Quizzler Flutter App

Quizzler is a simple true or false quiz app built with Flutter. It presents users with a series of statements and allows them to answer true or false. The app keeps track of the score and displays it visually using icons. Once all the questions are answered, it alerts the user that the quiz is over and allows them to restart.
